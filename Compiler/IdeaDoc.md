#IC11 language docs

##Misc
Need to investigate ways to store more then one varible in a register. If I find a method it should only be applyed when needed depending on the complexity of retriving a varible from a register with multiple varibles.

##Formating
Tabs will likly be important

##Conditional
```
if Statement1 == Statement2 {

}
```
Need to write a statement parser that can parse operations and follow order of operations

##Varible
No type hinting cause varibles can only be ints or floats or nan
